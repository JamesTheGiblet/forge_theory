## Abstract

The study of emergent phenomena, while critical across scientific disciplines, often remains fragmented within domain-specific silos, lacking a universal, empirically-grounded framework. This paper introduces Forge Theory, a unified model of emergence derived not from top-down postulation but from a novel, inductive, "builder-first" methodology. Over eight years, a systematic investigation was conducted by implementing 26 fully functional, open-source, zero-dependency simulations spanning six distinct domains: biological, cognitive, physical, cultural, economic, and meta-systemic.

Analysis of this diverse dataset revealed a recurring, universal architecture underlying all observed emergent phenomena. We formalize this pattern as the MAVRIC framework: a six-component decoder identifying the necessary conditions for emergence (**M**ulti-agent, **A**rchitecture, **V**olitional, **R**ecursive, **I**ntelligent, **C**ollective). Each of the 26 simulations serves as a concrete, reproducible validation of this framework's cross-domain applicability.

This work presents three primary contributions. First, it offers MAVRIC as a robust, universal lexicon for analyzing and comparing emergent systems. Second, it provides a comprehensive, open-source research platform of 26 simulations for pedagogical and scientific use. Third, it validates an inductive, implementation-driven research methodology where the process of discovery itself serves as a meta-level demonstration of emergence. By grounding theory in a vast and diverse portfolio of working systems, Forge Theory offers a significant step toward a unified science of complexity.

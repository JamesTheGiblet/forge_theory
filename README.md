## Exploring Emergence: How Simple Rules Create Complex Worlds

---

## What is Forge Theory?

Forge Theory is a collection of simulations and explorations that reveal a profound truth: **complexity and sophistication can arise from the simplest underlying rules**. Each project in this repository is a living demonstration of _emergence_—the phenomenon where intricate patterns, behaviors, and structures spontaneously form from basic interactions.

> **"Out of simplicity, complexity is born."**

## The Power of Simple Rules

Every simulation here is built on a foundation of elegantly simple mechanisms. Yet, from these, we witness the birth of:

- **Forests and trees** with intricate branching
- **Ecosystems** balancing predator and prey
- **Consciousness** from neural connections
- **Languages** with grammar and dialects
- **Life** from cell division and differentiation
- **Bodies** shaped by environmental pressures
- **Galaxies** formed by gravity and particles
- **Code** evolving through mutation and selection

# 🔮 FORGE THEORY ROADMAP

**Part of the [Forge Theory](https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/forge_theory) ecosystem**

This document outlines the future development plans for the Forge Theory ecosystem. Our goal is to expand the platform's capabilities, deepen the connections between simulations, and push the boundaries of what can be explored through emergent computation.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 🎯 Current Focus: Q4 2025

Our immediate priority is solidifying the existing ecosystem, improving documentation, and fostering community growth based on the newly unified 26-Forge framework.

---

## 🚀 Version 2.0 - "The Expansion" (Target: Q2 2025)

**Theme:** Enhancing the user experience and technical capabilities of individual Forges.

- [ ] **WebGL Acceleration:** Integrate WebGL for rendering in performance-critical Forges to allow for significantly larger and faster simulations.
- [ ] **Multi-agent Cooperation:** Introduce scenarios where agents can cooperate, not just compete, to achieve collective goals.
- [ ] **Parameter Preset Library:** Implement a system for saving, loading, and sharing interesting starting configurations for each Forge.
- [ ] **Simulation Recording & Playback:** Add functionality to record an emergent phenomenon and play it back, allowing for easier analysis and sharing.
- [ ] **Export to Video/GIF:** Enable users to export their creations and discoveries as shareable media.
- [ ] **Built-in Code Editor:** For select Forges, embed a simple code editor to allow for live tweaking of rules and parameters.
- [ ] **Mobile-Optimized Touch Controls:** Overhaul controls for a first-class experience on mobile and touch devices.
- [ ] **Dark/Light Mode:** Implement a universal theme switcher for all Forges to improve accessibility and user preference.

## 🔗 Version 2.5 - "The Connection" (Target: Q4 2025)

**Theme:** Weaving the individual Forges into a truly interconnected ecosystem.

- [ ] **Collaborative Multi-user Simulations:** Allow multiple users to interact with the same simulation instance in real-time using WebRTC.
- [ ] **Forge-to-Forge Communication:** Develop a protocol allowing outputs from one Forge to become inputs for another (e.g., a `MelodyForge` composition driving an `ArtForge` visualization).
- [ ] **Shared Pattern Database:** Create a community-driven database of interesting emergent patterns discovered across all Forges.
- [ ] **Community Preset Sharing:** Build a platform for users to upload and vote on their favorite presets.
- [ ] **Educational Curriculum Guides:** Develop formal lesson plans and guides for educators to use Forge Theory in the classroom.

---

## ✨ Version 3.0 - "The Transcendence" (Target: 2026)

**Theme:** Pushing into new dimensions of immersion, creativity, and autonomy.

- [ ] **3D Simulations:** Begin migrating key Forges (like `CosmicForge` and `BodyForge`) into 3D environments using libraries like Three.js.
- [ ] **VR/AR Experiences:** Create immersive virtual reality versions of select Forges, allowing users to step inside an emergent world.
- [ ] **Emergent Sound Synthesis:** Move beyond pre-set notes in `MelodyForge` to synthesizing sound waves directly based on emergent patterns.
- [ ] **Machine Learning Integration:** Allow neural networks within `NeuroForge` to evolve their own architectures or learning rules.
- [ ] **Autonomous Forge Generation (`ForgeMind`):** Achieve the first milestone of `ForgeMind` by having it autonomously generate a simple, novel Forge based on a high-level prompt.
- [ ] **Cross-Domain Emergence Experiments:** Create meta-Forges that combine rules from different domains (e.g., economic principles driving biological evolution).
- [ ] **Public API:** Develop a stable API for developers to programmatically control and extract data from simulations.

## 🌌 Long-Term Vision (The "North Star" Goals)

These are the ambitious, long-term goals that guide the project's overall direction. They represent the ultimate expression of a world built on emergent principles.

- **ForgeOS:** A complete, conceptual operating system where applications, data, and even the user interface are emergent properties of underlying agent interactions.
- **Forge IDE:** A specialized Integrated Development Environment designed specifically for creating, debugging, and visualizing emergent systems.
- **Forge Language:** A high-level, declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for describing emergence patterns, which can then be compiled into runnable simulations.
- **Forge Network:** A decentralized, distributed computing network where idle Forge instances around the world can contribute processing power to massive, shared simulations.
- **Forge Consciousness:** The ultimate meta-emergent goal: a state where the interactions across the entire Forge Network begin to exhibit novel, intelligent, and unpredictable behavior at a global scale.
